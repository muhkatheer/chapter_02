A Washington, D.C.-based developer has purchased the Kimpton Hotel Monaco Baltimore Inner Harbor for $18.6 million, a little more than half of what the downtown hotel sold for a decade ago.

Douglas Development said in a news release Monday that it plans to spend an additional $6.5 million renovating the N. Charles Street hotel, which is home to the B&O American Brasserie.

An arm of Kimpton Hotels & Restaurants bought the hotel in 2011 for $33 million following the bankruptcy of Baltimore and Charles Associates, which spent about $65 million to buy and renovate it from 2007 to 2009.

According to Douglas Development, the hotelâ€™s lender foreclosed on the property during the COVID-19 pandemic, and an affiliate of the same company, Stonehill Strategic Capital, bought the property at auction for $12 million in 2021.
